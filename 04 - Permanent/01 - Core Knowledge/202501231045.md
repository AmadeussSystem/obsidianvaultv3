# Algorithms 

- A sequence of finite steps to perform some specific task
## Properties of Algorithms 

- Terminate after finite amount of time.
- Produce alteast one output
- Independent of any Programming language.
- Unabiguous -> Deterministic mean like the output of an algorithm should remain constant with respect to time.

```Rust
fn main(){
while(true){
  println!("Hi There")//Not a valid Algorithm
 }//Please Dont run the code if you don't have a good stopping params or something to stop this code from running. 
}
```

- let scale the progress here 
```Rust 
fn main(){
let (x,y,z);
x = y + z;// How many times will this statement execute
}
```

- this will just execute once hence the O(1) ie constant time complexity
```Rust
fn main(){
let (x,y,z);
x = y + z; // This just runs once 
for i in 0..n{
  x = y + z; // This run n times 
 }
}
```
- hence commulativly (n+1) we ignore 1 due to insignificancee to growth Function, Hence the complexity will become O(n).
- Example 3 
```Rust
let (x,y,z);
x = y + z; // This just run once 
for i 0..n{
  x = y + z; // This run n times 
}
for i in 0..n{
 for j in 0..n{
    x = y + z;// This run n^2 times
  } 
}
```

- Hence the above equation will look something like $n^2 + n + 1$ we can negate n + 1 for $n \to \infty$ so the complexity becomes O(n<sup>2</sup>).
- Now how about this 
```Rust
fn main(){
let i = n;
while(i>1){
  i -= 3;// This run exactly n/3 times 
  print!("hi There");
 }
}
```
- as this run n/3 times we can generalise and say that the complexity is O(n)
- Should remember how to calc this exact equation

- ### Lets get some math out of the way
- #### For simple conditions:
- **Original:** `i > 1` (loop continues while `i > 1`).
- **Rewritten:** `i <= 1` (loop stops when `i <= 1`).

  - You switch the operator to its opposite:
     - `>` becomes `<=`
     - `<` becomes `>=`
     - == becomes != and vice-versa 
- #### For Compound Conditions
   - **Example 1:** Original: `x > 1 && y < 5`  
    Rewritten: `x <= 1 || y >= 5`
    
   - **Example 2:** Original: `a != b || c > 10`  
    Rewritten: `a == b && c <= 10`

- Mathematical Explaination behind the above code block
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Initial:} \quad i &= n \\
\text{First iteration:} \quad i &= n - 3 \\
\text{Second iteration:} \quad i &= n - 6 \\
&\vdots \\
\text{At the } k\text{-th iteration:} \quad i &= n - 3k \\ \\
\end{align}
$$$$
\begin{align}
\text{Stopping condition:} \quad n - 3k &\leq 1 \\
\text{Solve for } k: \quad k &= \frac{n - 1}{3}
\end{align}
$$
- this means the loop run for n-1/3 + 1 times.
- Example 6 
```Rust 
fn main(){
let i = 1;
while(i<n){
i = 2*i;
print!("{}",i); 
 }
}
```

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Intial } \ i &= n \\
\text{First Iter } i &= n^{1/2} \\
\text{Second Iter } i &= n^{1/4} \\
&\vdots \\
k \text{-th Iter } i &= n^{2k}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Running Condition } &\implies i>2 \\
\text{Stopping Condition } &\implies i\leq 2 \\ \\
\text{Solve this for } k \implies n^{1/2k} &= 2 \\
\therefore \ \log_{2}{n^{1/2k}} &= \cancel{ {\log_{2}{2}}K } \ 1 \\
\frac{1}{2^{k}} \log_{2}{n}  & = 1 \\
\log_{2}{n}  & = 2^{k} \\
\log_{2}{\log_{2}{n}}  & = k\ \cancel{ \log_{2}{2} }  \\
 \therefore \quad \boxed{ \log_{2}{\log_{2}{n}} = k}
\end{align}
$$

## HomeWork Questions 

```Rust 
fn main(){
let i = n;
while(i>2){
  i = i^1/25;
  print!("{}",i);
}
}
```

solution
$$
\begin{align} \\

k\text{-th iter} \implies i &= n^{1/25k} \\
\text{stopping Condition} \implies i & \leq 2 \\
\text{solve for } k \implies n^{1/25k}  & = 2
\end{align}
$$
