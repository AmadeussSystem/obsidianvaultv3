# Types of Environments 
- Fixed Environment 
- Dynamic Environment 
# Types of Agents 

- ### Simple Reflex Agent
  - it relies only on the current percept and disregards percept history 
  - They operate using condition action rule: if a condition holds the corresponding actions is exceuted.
  - these agents platofrms works well in fully observable environments 
  - in partially observable environments they often fall into infinite loop
  - Randomizing actions can help them avoid infinite loops.

- ### Problems in Simple Reflex Agent
  - Very limited Intelligence 
  - No knowledge of no non perceptual parts of the state 
  - Usually too big to to generate and store 
  - if there occurs any change in the environment, then the collection of rules needs to be updated.
```plaintext
function SimpleflexAgent(percept):
  state = InterpretePercept(percept)
  action = Rules(state)
  return action
    // Receives sensor input interpretes the environment state  applies the rules ,determines the actions and returns the
    decision
function InterpretePercept(percept):
  // Extract relevent information from the percept 
  // Return the current state based on the percept 

function Rules(state):
  // Apply relues based on the current state 
  // Return the actions to be taken based on the rules 
```

# Goal Based Agents
- ![[3-202501090935.png | 400]]
- Goal-based agents choose actions that minimize the distance to thier desired goal.
- They search and plan to find the ebst path to the foal among multiple options 
- Their knowlwdge is explicit and can be modified making them flexible 
- Changing the foal esialy alters their behaviors
### Key points 
- The knowledge of the current state environment is not always sufficient to decide for an agent what to do .
- the agent needs to know its goals which describes desirable situations.
- Goal based agent expand the capabilities of the model based agent by having the goal
```plaintext
function GOAL-BASED-AGENT(percept) returns an action
  persistent: state, the agents's current conception of the world state
  persistent: goal, a description of what the agent would like to achieve 
  persistent: reules, a set of condtion-action rules
  persistent: actions, the most recent actions, initailly none

  State <- UPDATE-STATE(state ,action, percept , goal)
  Rule  <- RULE-MATCH(state, rules, goal )
  action <- GET-ACTION(rule)
  return action
```
