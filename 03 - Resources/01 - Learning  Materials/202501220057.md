# Chapter 1 
## Computer and Numbers 
- Intergers are all the postive and negative number on the number line.
- Real Number are all the numbers on the number line including those between the intergers.
- Current Computer can't store real numbers as they have finite memory hence the need of approximation 
- In computer real number is genrally associated with floating point numbers
- For Example a computer cannot represent $\pi$ but only approimate it .
- for any Number in an arbitary base,B
$$
\dots d_{3}d_{2}d_{1} = \dots+d_{3}B^3+d_{2}B^2+d_{1}B^1+d_{0}B^0
$$
- Where $d\in[0,B-1]$. The symbol $\in$ means that $d$ is an element from the following set. If $B=8$, then $d$ is a number in $[0,7] = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \}$. The $ds$ are the digits. Each new digit to the left represents the next power of $B$
- We can contiue moving to the right, decresing the exponents on $B$ by one each time:
$$
d_{2}d_{1}d_{0}d_{-1}d_{-2}d_{-3}\mathrel{\dots}\,   = d_{2}B^2 + d_{0}B^1 +d_{0}B^0 + d_{-1}B^{1}+d_{-2}B^{-2}+d_{-3}B^{-3}+\mathrel{\dots}\, 
$$
- We write numbers in any base as collection of digits for the range of the base with an optional decimal point, which is more generally called *Radix point*, followed by more digitss. We take the set of valid digits. We take a set of valid digits from $[ 0,B-1 ]$ where B is the base.
## Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal
- A binary interget  is nothing more than a set of tally marks indicationg which powers of two get summed together.
$$
\begin{align}
1011_{2} &= 2^3+2^1+2^0 \\
&=8+2+1 \\
&=11  
\end{align}
$$

- Binary numbers with a *Radix Point* is less common, at least explicitly, but they are fundamental to the way computers manipulate floating point number.
$$
\begin{align}
1011.0101 &= 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 +2^{-2}+2^{-4} \\
&=8 +2+1+0.25+0.0625 \\
&=11.3125
\end{align}
$$
- Let see Python works with binary numbers.
---
 
 -> 0b10100101
 165
 ->bin(11)
 '0b1011'
 ->"{0:b}".format(11)
 1011
 ***
- the 0b prefix precedes binary constants. this prefix also work on GCC, similarly 0o for Octal numbers and 0x for the hex numbers 
- Just for info Python's Int function takes a second arguement , a base in $[2,36]$ for symbols 0 through 9 and A through Z regardless of case. This means we can interpret the string 11011 in many ways
---
-> x = '11011'
-> int(x), int(x,2),int(x,8),int(x,16)
(11011,27,4617,69649)
***
### For Rust

```Rust
fn main() {
    let x = "11011";

    // Interpret the string in different bases
    let base10 = i32::from_str_radix(x, 10).unwrap(); // Decimal
    let base2 = i32::from_str_radix(x, 2).unwrap();  // Binary
    let base8 = i32::from_str_radix(x, 8).unwrap();  // Octal
    let base16 = i32::from_str_radix(x, 16).unwrap(); // Hexadecimal

    println!("{:?}", (base10, base2, base8, base16)); // (11011, 27, 4617, 69649)
}
```

- here unwrap is used to catch potential errors

### Conversions Between Number Bases
- To go from base 2 to base 8 group digits by three from right to left 
$$
\begin{align}
1011110011101_{2} &\to 1 \ 001 \ 110 \ 011 \ 101 \\
&= 1 \ 3 \ 6 \ 3 \ 5 \\
&= 13635_{8}
\end{align}
$$
- similarly for base 16 group by fours:
$$
\begin{align}
1011110011101_{2} &\to 1 \ 0111 \ 1001 \ 1101 \\
&= 1 \ 7 \ 9 \ 13 \\
&= 1 \ 7 \ 9 \ D \\
&=179D_{16}
\end{align}
$$
- This process works for any base that's a power of 2. If base 32 suits your fancy, group by five.
- To convert from Octal to hex, or vice versa, I find it quickest to move through base 2 by reversing the earliar process:
$$
\begin{align}
13635_{8} &\to 1\ 3\ 6\ 3 \ 5 \\
&= 1 \ 011 \ 110 \ 011 \ 101 \\
&= 101111011101_{2} \\
&= 1 \ 0111 \ 1001 \ 1101 \\
&= 1 \ 7 \ 9 \ 13 \\
&=179D_{16}
\end{align}
$$

- Another approach is to use the Horner's method 
$$
\begin{align}
d_{0} &= 0 \\
d_{i} &= b_{k-i} + Bd_{i-1}\ ,i =1\mathrel{\dots}\, k
\end{align}
$$
- Will be explain later!!!
- the following algorithms converts the decimal to binary and work for any other base 
```Python
def dec2base(d,b):
    def digit(r):
        return chr(48 + r if r<10 else 55+r)
    d,r = d//b, d%b
    m = digit(r)
    while d! = 0:
        d,r = d//b,d%b
        m +=digit(r)  
    return m[::-1]
```
  - An n-bit binary number is capable of storing values from $[0,2^n-1]$, which means different data types have different allowed ranges this is considering unsigned intergers
  - For signed integers range becomes $[-2^{n-1},2^{n-1}-1]$ 
  - just for mental 1 byte = 8 bit I often tend to forget that
  - Consider this bit pattern 
  $$
\begin{align}
11001010 \ 11010011_{2}
\end{align}
$$
  - This pattern os 16 bit bit is either -13,613 or 51,923, depnding on whether we consider it a signed or unsigned interger. But how does the computer store these 16 biys in its memory? We need 2 bytes of memory to store a 16-bit interger. if we're sensible, thsi mewans that 1 byte will get $11001010_{2}$ and the other will get $11010011_{2}$. if we have two consecutive memory locations available, say 1177 and 1178, do we put the 2 bytes in memory like this 
  $$
\begin{align}
 1177 \ &: 11001010_{2} \\
\ 1178 \ &: 11010011_{2}
\end{align}
$$

     or like this 
     
$$
\begin{align}
1177 \ &: 11010011_{2} \\
1178 \ &: 11001010_{2} 
\end{align}
$$
  - In other words, do we store the high-rder byte in the lower memory location followed by the low-order byte or the other way around? Do we use big-endian or little-endian? *Endianness* is the way numbers are stored, byte by byte in the computer memory. If we store the high-rder bytes first, we're using *big-endian* order,sometimes called *network order*. If we store the lower-order bytes first, we're using *little-endian* order. This typically depends on CPU for example Intel and AMD CPUs use *little-endian* so If a number occupies 4 b;ytes of memory, the first byte(lowest memory location) contains the lowest-order 8 bits. In most cases, programmer pay no attention to endianness until it suddenly rears it ugly head and bites them on the backside. This happens most often by other when moving data over a network, reading binary files written buy other when moving data over from sensors.
