# Chapter 1 
## Computer and Numbers 
- Intergers are all the postive and negative number on the number line.
- Real Number are all the numbers on the number line including those between the intergers.
- Current Computer can't store real numbers as they have finite memory hence the need of approximation 
- In computer real number is genrally associated with floating point numbers
- For Example a computer cannot represent $\pi$ but only approimate it .
- for any Number in an arbitary base,B
$$
\dots d_{3}d_{2}d_{1} = \dots+d_{3}B^3+d_{2}B^2+d_{1}B^1+d_{0}B^0
$$
- Where $d\in[0,B-1]$. The symbol $\in$ means that $d$ is an element from the following set. If $B=8$, then $d$ is a number in $[0,7] = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \}$. The $ds$ are the digits. Each new digit to the left represents the next power of $B$
- We can contiue moving to the right, decresing the exponents on $B$ by one each time:
$$
d_{2}d_{1}d_{0}d_{-1}d_{-2}d_{-3}\mathrel{\dots}\,   = d_{2}B^2 + d_{0}B^1 +d_{0}B^0 + d_{-1}B^{1}+d_{-2}B^{-2}+d_{-3}B^{-3}+\mathrel{\dots}\, 
$$
- We write numbers in any base as collection of digits for the range of the base with an optional decimal point, which is more generally called *Radix point*, followed by more digitss. We take the set of valid digits. We take a set of valid digits from $[ 0,B-1 ]$ where B is the base.
## Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal
- A binary interget  is nothing more than a set of tally marks indicationg which powers of two get summed together.
$$
\begin{align}
1011_{2} &= 2^3+2^1+2^0 \\
&=8+2+1 \\
&=11  
\end{align}
$$

- Binary numbers with a *Radix Point* is less common, at least explicitly, but they are fundamental to the way computers manipulate floating point number.
$$
\begin{align}
1011.0101 &= 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 +2^{-2}+2^{-4} \\
&=8 +2+1+0.25+0.0625 \\
&=11.3125
\end{align}
$$
- Let see Python works with binary numbers.

 ***
- the 0b prefix precedes binary constants. this prefix also work on GCC, similarly 0o for Octal numbers and 0x for the hex numbers
