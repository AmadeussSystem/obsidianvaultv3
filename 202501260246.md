- # Set and Abstract Algebra
  - ## Concerning Sets
    - A set is collections of things. In maths set are usually numbers or other sets
    $$
    \begin{align}
    S = \{ 1,2,5 \} \to \text{Generally represented by uppercase Letter}
    \end{align}
    $$
    - The cardinality of a set, denoted by $|S|$, is the number of elements it contains. Therefore $|S| = 3$. Sets may be of infinite cardinality, for example:
    $$
    N = \{ 1,2,3,4,\mathrel{\dots}\, \} \to N \ \text{for Natural Numbers}
    $$
      - Defines $N$ to be positive numbers. The dots $(\mathrel{\dots}\,)$ represent that it is an infinite set, so $|N| = \infty$, where $\infty$ is the symbol for infinity. Note $\infty$ is not a number itself, just a representation of "without ending," though not all infinity is created equally.
    $$
    W = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,\mathrel{\dots} \} \to \text{includes 0}
    $$

  - ## Different Set Notations
  - Example:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    A & = \{ 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 \} \\
    & \downarrow \\
    A & = \{ x \ | \ x \in W, x < 20, \ x \ \text{is even} \} \\
    & \text{(or)} \\
    A & = \{ x \ | \ x \in W, x < 20, \ x \ \% 2 == 0 \}
    \end{align}
    $$

- ## Special Sets 
  1. $\mathbb{Z}$ → Sets of Integers
  2. $\mathbb{Q}$ → Rational Numbers (Ratio of two integers)
  3. $\mathbb{R}$ → Real Numbers (Everything on the number line)
  4. $\mathbb{C}$ → Complex Numbers ($a + bi$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{R} \cap i = \sqrt{-1}$)
  5. $\mathbb{H}$ → Quaternions (Hamiltonians), 4-Dimensional Numbers
  6. $\mathbb{O}$ → Octonions, 8-Dimensional Numbers
  7. $\mathbb{S}$ → Sedenions, 16-Dimensional Numbers

    - Another special set is the empty set, denoted by $\phi$ or $\{ \}$. Note that $\phi$ and $\{ \phi \}$ are not the same. The former is an empty set, whereas the latter is a set containing an empty set. The cardinality of the empty set is zero, while the cardinality of $\{ \phi \}$ is 1 as it is a set containing a single element that happens to be an empty set.
    - Irrational numbers are those real numbers, like $\sqrt{3}$, that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers.
    - The Real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) are therefore split between Rational and Irrational Numbers. Another way to split real numbers is between Algebraic Numbers (numbers that can be roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients, e.g., $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational but algebraic number because it is a root of $x^2 - 2 = 0$) and Transcendental Numbers (real numbers that are not algebraic, e.g., $\pi$). Almost all real numbers are transcendental, but only a handful have been proven to be so.

- ## Set Operations 
  - There are four basic set operations: union, intersection, set difference, and symmetric difference.
  - **Union**
    $$
    \begin{align}
    A & = \{ 1,3,4,5,7 \} \\
    B & = \{ 0,2,4 \} \\
    A \cup B & = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,7 \}
    \end{align}
    $$

  - **Intersection**
    $$
    \begin{align}
    A & = \{ 1,3,4,5,7 \} \\
    B & = \{ 0,2,4 \} \\
    A \cap B & = \{ 4 \}
    \end{align}
    $$

  - **Set Difference**  
    $$
    \begin{align}
    A & = \{ 1,3,4,5,7 \} \\
    B & = \{ 0,2,4 \} \\
    A - B & = \{ 1,3,5,7 \}
    \end{align}
    $$

  - **Symmetric Difference**
    $$
    \begin{align}
    A & = \{ 1,3,4,5,7 \} \\
    B & = \{ 0,2,4 \} \\
    A \triangle B & = \{ 0,1,2,3,5,7 \} \\
    A \triangle B & = (A - B) \cup (B - A)
    \end{align}
    $$

    - **Note**: $\wedge$ means "and," $\vee$ means "or."

  - ### Definitions of Set Operations in Set-Builder Form:
    - **Union**: $\{ x \ | \ x \in A \vee x \in B \}$
    - **Intersection**: $\{ x \ | \ x \in A \wedge x \in B \}$
    - **Difference**: $\{ x \ | \ x \in A \wedge x \not\in B \}$
    - **Symmetric Difference**: $\{ x \ | \ x \in A \wedge x \not\in B \} \cup \{ x \ | \ x \in B \wedge x \not\in A \}$

- ## Set Operations in Python
  
```python
A = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}  # A is a set, not a dictionary, as it lacks key-value pairs
B = {0, 2, 4}
C = set()  # Create an empty set, but in this case Python interprets it as an empty dictionary
```

```Python
X = {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4}
Y = list(set(X))
print(Y)
```

```Rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
fn main(){
let x = vec![1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4];
let y:Vec<_> = x.into_iter().collect::<HashSet<_>>().into_iter().collect();
println!("{:?}",y)
}
```

```plaintext
x.into_iter() iterates the element of Vectors one by one.
.collect::<HashSet<_>>() This collects method takes the iterates and collect its item into a new  HashSet

```

```Python
# Four Basic Set operations 
A = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}  # A is a set, not a dictionary, as it lacks key-value pairs
B = {0, 2, 4}

# Union
print(A | B)  # Output: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

# Intersection
print(A & B)  # Output: {4}

# Difference
print(A - B)  # Output: {1, 3, 5, 7}

# Symmetric Difference
print(A ^ B)  # Output: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}

```
